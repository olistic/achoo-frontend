Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n\t * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n\t * needs to query its data.\n\t *\n\t *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n\t *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n\t *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n\t *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n\t *\n\t *       // Select the default city for the new country\n\t *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n\t *\n\t *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n\t *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n\t *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n\t *         case 'country-update':\n\t *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n\t *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n\t *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n\t *           break;\n\t *\n\t *         case 'city-update':\n\t *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n\t *             FlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n\t *           break;\n\t *     }\n\t *   });\n\t *\n\t * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n\t * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n\t * `FlightPriceStore`.\n\t */\n\t\n\t  function Dispatcher() {\n\t    this.$Dispatcher_callbacks = {};\n\t    this.$Dispatcher_isPending = {};\n\t    this.$Dispatcher_isHandled = {};\n\t    this.$Dispatcher_isDispatching = false;\n\t    this.$Dispatcher_pendingPayload = null;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.

This is\n * different from generic pub-sub systems in two ways:\n *\n *   1) Callbacks are not subscribed to particular events. Every payload is\n *      dispatched to every registered callback.\n *   2) Callbacks can be deferred in whole or part until other callbacks have\n *      been executed.\n *\n * For example, consider this hypothetical flight destination form, which\n * selects a default city when a country is selected:\n *\n *   var flightDispatcher = new Dispatcher();\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which country is selected\n *   var CountryStore = {country: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of which city is selected\n *   var CityStore = {city: null};\n *\n *   // Keeps track of the base flight price of the selected city\n *   var FlightPriceStore = {price: null}\n *\n * When a user changes the selected city, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'city-update',\n *     selectedCity: 'paris'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by `CityStore`:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'city-update') {\n *       CityStore.city = payload.selectedCity;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the user selects a country, we dispatch the payload:\n *\n *   flightDispatcher.dispatch({\n *     actionType: 'country-update',\n *     selectedCountry: 'australia'\n *   });\n *\n * This payload is digested by both stores:\n *\n *    CountryStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       CountryStore.country = payload.selectedCountry;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * When the callback to update `CountryStore` is registered, we save a reference\n * to the returned token. Using this token with `waitFor()`, we can guarantee\n * that `CountryStore` is updated before the callback that updates `CityStore`\n * needs to query its data.\n *\n *   CityStore.dispatchToken = flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *     if (payload.actionType === 'country-update') {\n *       // `CountryStore.country` may not be updated.\n *       flightDispatcher.waitFor([CountryStore.dispatchToken]);\n *       // `CountryStore.country` is now guaranteed to be updated.\n *\n *       // Select the default city for the new country\n *       CityStore.city = getDefaultCityForCountry(CountryStore.country);\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The usage of `waitFor()` can be chained, for example:\n *\n *   FlightPriceStore.dispatchToken =\n *     flightDispatcher.register(function(payload) {\n *       switch (payload.actionType) {\n *         case 'country-update':\n *           flightDispatcher.waitFor([CityStore.dispatchToken]);\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             getFlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *\n *         case 'city-update':\n *           FlightPriceStore.price =\n *             FlightPriceStore(CountryStore.country, CityStore.city);\n *           break;\n *     }\n *   });\n *\n * The `country-update` payload will be guaranteed to invoke the stores'\n * registered callbacks in order: `CountryStore`, `CityStore`, then\n * `FlightPriceStore`.\n */\n\n  function Dispatcher() {\n    this.$Dispatcher_callbacks = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isPending = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isHandled = {};\n    this.$Dispatcher_isDispatching = false;\n    this.$Dispatcher_pendingPayload = null;\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a callback to be invoked with every dispatched payload.
